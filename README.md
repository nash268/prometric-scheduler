- When running the script for the first time, it will prompt you with a few relevant questions.
- The provided values are then saved in the `user_input.txt` file.
- Subsequent runs of the script will automatically load values from the `user_input.txt` file.
- To update the stored values, simply delete the `user_input.txt` file and rerun the script.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do Not! change any file names in prometric-scheduler folder for scheduling to work properly.

### Linux and MacOs
- For Linux and MacOS users, the script utilizes crontab for scheduling automatic runs. Visit [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/#*/30_*_*_*_*) to configure the timing.
- once you have found your seats(hooray!!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³), to remove all cronjobs run `crontab -r` command in terminal.
### Windows
- on Windows, script utilizes Windows Task Scheduler. after running the script search task scheduler in start menu and see if the task is created.
